```

## **Usage**

1. Open the link from the [Demo](https://udsgit.github.io/chest-collector) or open the file **index.html** if you downloaded it.
2. Now you can interact with the "Game".
3. To move, you will use the arrows on the keyboard and you can take the chests that will appear. The game only consists of that, since it is a first contact.
